Unfortunately, despite lots of trial and error I could not figure out how to get
the program to pass any tests. It helped slightly to follow stack traces and make the LLM hyperfocus on specific methods, but maybe due to the errors being too complicated for the LLM or me just not having enough understanding of working on AST's, it seemed as though none of the fixes worked and I ended up in a cycle of despair. Even switching models to ChatGPT did not help things, in fact it made it worse. I noticed that ChatGPT made significantly more errors and displayed alot more "yes man" tendencies, even making the same exact mistake several times in a row. It got to the point where my only hope was trying to go into the files and change things myself but nothing worked. It seems as though the capabilities of AI (at least from my understanding of how to use them) seem to hit a plateau. I'm going to need to do more research on development techniques with AI because it's hard for me to believe that people can get away with not looking at the code like one of the required course articles talks about.
