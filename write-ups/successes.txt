Despite a very significant amount going wrong with this project, I found that directing the LLM to documentation as well as specific examples of files I wanted it to refer to (like the TreeAnnotator type) helped a lot with it developing a plan. I also had it explain exactly what it was doing with each change, and several times I had to stop it and point it in the right direction. I've been findingthat with AI-assisted development it's not just really effective but also crucial to be watching over its shoulder very carefully and seeing what it's writing as it's doing its work. The fact that the project is documented helps significantly with understanding how to expand the project and what patterns to follow. It seemed to pick up very quickly how the project worked. Feeding it bits and pieces from the man page also helped steer it in the right direction in my personal opinion.
